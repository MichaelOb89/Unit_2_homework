## What do the HTTP Status Codes represent?

Status codes are issued by a server in response to a clients request, and represent whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.

## What are the Primary HTTP Verbs and what do they mean?
* Informational response – the request was received, continuing process
* Successful – the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted
* Redirection – further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
* Client error – the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
* Server error – the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request
